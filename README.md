# Basic platformer
## general principle
This project has for aim to be the base for others basics platformers, and mainly the **CaC-game** project.
By this way, I mean that this code is destined to be modified to create more sophisticated platformers. (for exemple, add mobs)

It is off course not perfect, because it's alway in developpement!
